SI.SPR.PC40.ZG,"Annualized growth in survey mean consumption or income per capita, bottom 40% (%, based on 2005 PPP)","The growth rate in the welfare aggregate of the bottom 40% is computed as the annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the bottom 40% of the population in  the income distribution in a country from household surveys over a roughly 5-year period. The final year of the growth period (T1) is defined as the most recent survey year no earlier than 2009. The initial year (T0) is defined as close to (T1 - 5) as possible, with a bandwidth of +/- 2 years; thus the gap between initial and final survey years ranges from 3 to 7 years. If two surveys are equidistant from (T1 - 5), all other things being equal, the more recent survey year is selected as T0. In the database, growth rates are assigned to the final year of the period used, i.e. T1.","World Bank, Global Database of Shared Prosperity (GDSP) circa 2006 - 2011 (http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/brief/global-database-of-shared-prosperity)."

SI.POV.GINI,GINI index (World Bank estimate),"Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.","World Bank, Development Research Group.
